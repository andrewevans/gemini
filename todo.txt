workflow of deleting an artist that has belongsTo artworks attached to it. Should it allow and orphan those artworks or delete those artworks?

downloaded/installed a wp plugin to fetch category_name
in /Users/vesper/Sites/gemini/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/post-tags-and-categories-for-pages/post-tag.php i edited the function to just return. on update of that plugin it will revert and show all posts AND pages!

there's words like 'lithographs' and 'bio' that CANT be titles of pieces if doing /artists/NAME/TITLE

'dog' search doesn't find 3570 and 2963 like it should! maybe parens and quotes in fields?

make sure /artists/ARTIST-URL-SLUG/blah/id/ARTWORK-ID that artist url slug and artwork ID are consistent with each other

need alt/title attributes SEO text

favico

endless scroll

bold text that is searched and matched in dropdown typeahead list
make accents show up in dropdown typeahead list

has no image, not even placeholder? http://gemini.andrew.com/artists/pablo-picasso/ceramic-madoura-sculpture/mat-dove-1948/id/4482

needs better image not found image

good 404 page http://bootsnipp.com/snippets/featured/sample-404-page

since overloading the filter slot of URL, a medium can't be called "Bible Series" and a series can't be called "Lithographs"

do series sometimes have several names, like "Bible Series" and "Illustrations from the Bible"

does a piece ever belong to more than one series? i'm thinking no, but then again a piece might be "blue period" and "rose period" at the same time

for pablo-picasso/blue-period the bio should be specifically about the blue period with maybe a boiler about overall picasso bio
for pablo-picasso/ceramics " "

also, pages and posts pulled should be about the filter first, then the rest. We want the page to be THE page for that artist+filter

pages like http://gemini.andrew.com/artists/pablo-picasso///id/4967 have no medium or slug so it has several slashes. needs fallback

add list of museums, people, etc. to search and have pages or external links!

have artworks marked as featured

yields no results yet it should because there are 2 pieces with 'dog' in title http://gemini.andrew.com/search?q=dog%29&q_id=

make design such that the '+' maximize makes the window open all the way (like in Mac Chrome)

canonical urls

artworks need <title>

catalogues and other URLS need to check that the artist matches to make sure bullshit URLs can't be made like /chagall/picassos-catalogue-of-ceramics

For entering catalogue data:
list artists by last_name, first_name

get fonts locally as backup!

people need pages/posts/catalogues on /people/URL_SLUG

figure out canonical URLs for wp pages like "Picasso and Braque", right now it has two distinct URLs but same content! is it braque's or picasso's or the default wp.andrew.com url?

design still needs social icons

in Setup, show artists in drop down like LASTNAME, Firstname

needs multiple types of ckeditor, UX sucks when typing in small box

model should check a-z, no spaces, etc. for things like slug

catrefs catalogue list needs artist like "(PICASSO) Raime edition blah blah" and order by artist last_name

make background a color that matches that artist/artwork/style? like pink at http://www.warhol.org/exhibitions/2012/15minuteseternal/en/index.html

focus cursor on search on homepage?

apostrophes in title for URL should be ignored, not turned into a dash... or should it?

eager loading for artworks->with(artist)

stupid rule where 'unique' also has to be unique in that actual row too. STUPID!!

need google's recaptcha or something art related

have mail to boss man be FROM the customer, needs to send thru server? via php mail()?

remember to add robots.txt and block in robots and on page /purchase, /offer, etc. and NOARCHIVE for artist/artwork pages

admin search needs to use same api as on-site search. Right now it just looks for the string in the title

what if article is about more than one artist? needs link at bottom saying 'also available at [url]' for other urls so dont get dinged for duplicate content

get on in-depth articles https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/3280182?hl=en
articles need authorship info!!!!

when there are only two pieces, the featured card looks funny

find a place to store the db backup commands:
cd ~/scripts/ && sudo ./calder_db_backup.sh && sudo ./gemini_db_backup.sh && sudo ./gemini_db_import.sh
