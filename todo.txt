workflow of deleting an artist that has belongsTo artworks attached to it. Should it allow and orphan those artworks or delete those artworks?

downloaded/installed a wp plugin to fetch category_name
in /Users/vesper/Sites/gemini/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/post-tags-and-categories-for-pages/post-tag.php i edited the function to just return. on update of that plugin it will revert and show all posts AND pages!
what if article is about more than one artist? needs link at bottom saying 'also available at [url]' for other urls so dont get dinged for duplicate content

there's words like 'lithographs' and 'bio' that CANT be titles of pieces if doing /artists/NAME/TITLE
